I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and stained glass artist. I love programming, puzzles, books, and traveling. In my free time, I enjoy getting my hands dirty as a novice homesteader and playing videogames (RPGs are my favorite).

As a web developer, I love to leverage my eye for aesthetic and problem solving skills to design polished pages and apps with powerful backend functionality.
